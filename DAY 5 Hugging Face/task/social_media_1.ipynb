      "**Tone:** Post 1 has a confident and triumphant tone, while Post 2 has a disappointed and regretful tone. A positive tone is generally more engaging and appealing than a negative one.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Engagement Potential:** Post 1 is likely to spark engagement and inspire others to share their own fitness achievements, as it's a motivational and uplifting message. Post 2, on the other hand, may elicit sympathy or commiseration, but it's unlikely to inspire engagement or encourage others to share their own experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Emotional Appeal:** Post 1 has a strong emotional appeal, as it conveys a sense of accomplishment and pride. This can resonate with followers and make them feel good. Post 2, while relatable, has a negative emotional tone that may not be as appealing or inspiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, I conclude that Post 1 would perform better on social media. The positive tone, motivational message, and sense of accomplishment are likely to resonate with followers and inspire engagement. Additionally, the hashtags #fitness and #goals can help increase the post's visibility and reach a wider audience. Post 2, while relatable, may not be as engaging or appealing, and may even have a negative impact on followers' mood.\n"
